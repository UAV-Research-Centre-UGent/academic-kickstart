title: "CLIMABIS"
subtitle: "2021-2024"
summary: "CLIMABIS is a VLAIO-funded project between Ghent University and Globachem. The project includes an IPM approach to control climate-intensified biotic and abiotic stress in wheat. We will try to manage yellow rust and drought stress through a three-step approach. First, prevention by using biocontrol agents and biostimulants. Next, setting up a method to monitor the condition of crops through UAV-mounted hyperspectral and thermal cameras. And lastly, according to the principles of precision agriculture, intervention with biological products combined with a reduced amount of chemical pesticides in the affected areas of the field."
