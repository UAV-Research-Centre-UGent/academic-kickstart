Wouter Maes is tenure track professor in vegetation monitoring with UAVs and co-leads the UGent UAV Research Centre (URC). With a background in forest ecology and plant physiology, he received his PhD in 2010 at KULeuven on thermal remote sensing applications for vegetation monitoring and stress detection. In his postdoc years at UGent and UTS, Sydney, he focused on applying UAVs for thermal and hyperspectral remote sensing, as well as on sun-induced fluorescence. In his current position, he is applying his UAV remote sensing expertise for precision agriculture applications and ecological applications.
