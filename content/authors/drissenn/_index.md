After receiving his research masterâ€™s degree in models, systems and imaging from Clermont Ferrand Auvergne University (UCA) in France, Driss EN-NEJJARY joined the INRAE (National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment), and LIMOS (Laboratory of Informatics, Modelling and Optimization of the Systems) to pursue his PhD in environmental data processing using GPGPU. Currently, he is a postdoctoral researcher at the UAV Research Center of Ghent University. His research revolves around using Deep Learning for direct assessment of food losses and yield in vegetable and fruit crop fields using UAV-based very high-resolution RGB data.
