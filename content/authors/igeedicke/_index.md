Ina Geedicke currently works as a guest scientist affiliated with the University of Ghent. During her PhD, she worked on the impact of human development on intertidal wetlands in Australia. Her PhD was part of a Joint PhD program between University of Hamburg and Macquarie University in Sydney. Since then she has worked as a post-doctoral associate at the University of Florida and is now a scholarship holder of the Professorin RÃ¼bsamen-Schaeff scholarship that promotes early career research for women in science. During her career she had the opportunity to work in different anthropogenically influenced ecosystems, i.e. managed heathlands, wetlands in proximity to urban development and agricultural landscapes.
